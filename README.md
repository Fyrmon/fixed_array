# fixed_array

Welcome to **`fixed_array`** — my little monument to poor decisions and curiosity,again.

It’s mostly an excuse to mess around with **C++**, **templates**, **CMake**, and **Conan**.
Getting to know them by playing and having fun.

### 🧩 What it actually does

- It pretends to be `std::array`,badly.
- It holds data,barely.  
- It iterates,slowly.
- Its safe,not.

### Tests?
There are **Google Tests** (gtest), but honestly, they are just prayers written in C++.

### ⚙️ Build and Run

```bash
Trust me, You don't want to.
```

### Closing Thoughts

Not perfection — just progress. Not order — just understanding.
A map of my mistakes, drawn in code like an abstract painting — beautiful in intent, horrifying in hindsight.
